# Archietcture and Experiment Analysis

## Introduction and Motivation

The problem this project aims to solve is an optimal method the calibration of the Heston model. When we calibrate the Heston model we are trying to find the five values for these parameters that match the market dynamics as close as possible. Intuitively one would define a loss function between model prices and market prices and try to minimise it, the problem with this is that mapping from these parameters to option prices is extremely non-linear. This means that the loss function has an extremely complicated shape with many local minima, thus two very different parameterisation can produce almost identical prices. Classic optimisers work iteritevaly, first guess some parameters, then compute the loss, then adjust the parameters and repeat until it converges, which requires significant computation. The Machine Learning approach sidesteps this problem entirely. We do all the expensive computation once at training time and then at inference we can just do a single forward pass of the model, which is just a fixed sequence of matrix operations.

Mathematically, a volatility surface is simply a set of $(K, T, \sigma)$ triples, there is no canonical ordering. Thus, the function that our machine learning model will attempt to approximate will be a permutation invariant function acting on sets. We define these terms as following:

A function acting on sets is a map

$$
f : 2^X \to Y,
$$

where $2^X$ denotes the power set of $X$.

A function $f : 2^X \to Y$ acting on sets is permutation invariant if, for any permutation $\pi$,

$$
f(\{x_1,\ldots,x_M\}) = f(\{x_{\pi(1)},\ldots,x_{\pi(M)}\}).
$$

It can be further demonstrated that a function $f : 2^X \to Y$ acting on sets is permutation invariant if and only if it can be decomposed as

$$
f(X) = \rho\left(\sum_{x \in X} \phi(x)\right),
$$

for suitable transformations $\phi$ and $\rho$, which in the machine learning context will usually be an encoder ($\phi$), and a decoder ($\rho$) which are composed of several layers.

For these reasons we propose a variant of the Set Transformer for this problem, where the encoder and decoder functions are:

$$\phi(X) = SAB(SAB(X))$$

$$\rho(Z) = rFF(PMA_{4}(Z))$$

Where SAB is a self attention block layer, $PMA_{4}$ is a pooling by multi-head attention layer with 4 seed vectors, rFF is a feedforward network. We will now explicate the function of these layers.

### Diagram 1 - Self Attention Block architecture

Self-attention is a mechanism is a mechanism that relates different elements of a set or sequence, with a goal of computing a represntation of this set/sequence. This mechanism has the advantage that the are no recurrence relations between elements, so all elements are related in a single operation ($O(1)$ path length). Given 3 vectors Q (the query), K (the key), and V (the value), we compute:

$$Attention(Q,K,V) = Softmax(\frac{QK^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{k}}})V$$

where $d_{k}$ is the dimension of the vector K. Multi-head attention linearly projects the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to $d_{k}$ , $d_{k}$ and $d_{v}$ dimensions, and is computed by:

$$MultiHead(Q,K,V) = Concat(head_{1}, ... , head_{h})W^{O}$$

$$head_{i} = Attention(QW_{i}^{Q}, KW_{i}^{K}, VW_{i}^{V})$$

Where $W_{i}^{Q}$, $W_{i}^{K}$, $W_{i}^{V}$, and $W^{O}$ are learned weight matrices.

A Multi-head attention block is a function on to sets X and Y defined by:

$$MAB(X,Y) = LayerNorm(H + rFF(H)), H = LayerNorm(X + MultiHead(X,Y,Y))$$

Where LayerNorm is the layer normalisation operation (see Training and Evaluation section). Finally we define the set attention block as a function on a set X, given by:

$$SAB(X) = MAB(X,X)$$
