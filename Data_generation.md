## Introduction

Traditional pricing models like Black-Scholes fail to capture the volatility smile that occurs in real option markets. Heston introduces mean reverting stochastic volatility with five parameters $(\kappa, \theta, \xi, \rho, v_0)$ that when combined can explain smile shape, skew and term structure in real option chains.

The problem this project aims to solve is mapping a volatility surface (in the form of a set of $(K, T, \sigma^{\text{IV}})$ triplets), to the Heston parameters $(\kappa, \theta, \xi, \rho, v_0)$. We do this using a machine learning approach, in order to solve this problem in this mannaer we need a labelled dataset where each datapoint is in the form $(\mathbf{X}_i, \Psi_i)$, where $\mathbf{X}_i = \{(\log m_j, \sqrt{\tau_k}, \sigma_j^{\text{IV}})\}$ is the implied volatility surface, and $\Psi_i = (v_0, \kappa, \theta, \xi, \rho)$ is a parameter vector of the calibrated Heston model proper to this surface.

## The Heston Model

The Heston model specifies the dynamics of both an asset price $S_t$ and its instantaneous variance $v_t$, according to the following SDEs:

$$dS_t = r S_t dt + \sqrt{v_t} S_t dW_t^S$$

$$dv_t = \kappa(\theta - v_t) dt + \xi \sqrt{v_t} dW_t^v$$

$$d\langle W^S, W^v \rangle_t = \rho  dt$$

Where $v_0 > 0$ is the initial variance of the process, $\theta > 0$ is the long-run variance (ie the value that $v_t$ reverts to), $\kappa > 0$ is the aggressiveness of this mean-reversion, $\xi > 0$ is the volatility of the variance process ("vol-of-vol"), and $\rho \in (-1,1)$ is the correlation between the Brownian motions of the asset price and variance (encodes the leverage effect, of higher variance reducing leverage and hence price).

Additonally the model must find some way to guarantee that the variance is strictly positive, this is done via the **Feller Condition.** which enforces that $2\kappa\theta > \xi^2$ which is sufficient to ensure $v_t > 0$ because as $v_t \to 0$, $\xi \sqrt{v_t} \to 0$ and $\kappa(\theta - v_t) \to \kappa\theta$ so the Feller Condition ensures the upward drift is large enough relative to the noise term that $v_t$ cannot reach zero within a finite amount of time.

## Heston Characteristic Function Pricing & Fourier Transforms

Under the Heston model,the log asset price ($\log{S_T}$), has no closed-form density (the integrated-variance term is intractable), so we cannot price options using it by integrating a known density against the payoff like the Black–Scholes model does. However although the density is unavailable, its Fourier transform (the characteristic function) is available in closed form

$$\varphi_X(u) = \mathbb{E}\left[e^{iuX}\right] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{iux} f_X(x)dx$$

The inversion Theorem says the forward transform doesn't lose any information, thus $f_X(x)$ can be rebuilt from $\varphi_X(u)$ by reassembling its frequency components, and is given by:

$$f_{\log S_T}(x)= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-iux}\varphi(u;\tau,\Psi)du$$

Where $\varphi(u;\tau,\Psi)$ is the Heston Characteristic function given by

$$ \varphi(u;\tau,\Psi) = \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[e^{iu \log S_T}\right] = e^{iu \log S_0}\varphi_{\mathrm{ret}}(u;\tau,\Psi) $$

$$ \varphi_{\mathrm{ret}}(u;\tau,\Psi) = \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[e^{iu \log(S_T/S_0)}\right] $$

## The Closed-Form Characteristic Function & Feyman-Kac Equation

Take a process driven by an SDE with drift $\mu$ and diffusion $\sigma$:

$$ dX_t = \mu(X_t,t)dt + \sigma(X_t,t)dW_t $$

and define a function:

$$f(x,t) = \mathbb{E}\left[g(X_T)\mid X_t = x\right]$$

the expected payoff $g$ at maturity, given you're at state $x$ now. Feynman–Kac states that $f$ solves the PDE:

$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+ \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 0,\qquad f(x,T) = g(x) $$

Within our context this means that the characteristic function $f(u,\tau)=\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}[e^{iu\log S_T}]$ must satisfy the backward PDE which we obtain by applying Feynman–Kac to the two-factor Heston dynamics. 

Because Heston is an *affine* model, meaning the drift and the squared diffusion (the variance) of every state variable are in an affine form (constant-plus-linear), we can look for a solution that is exponential-affine in the state:

$$f = \exp\big(C(\tau) + D(\tau)v_0 + iu\log S_0\big)$$

Substituting this ansatz into the PDE and collecting powers of $v$ collapses the PDE into two ODEs, one being a Riccati equation for $D$ and a direct integral for $C$. 

$$ \frac{dD}{d\tau} = \frac{1}{2}\xi^2 D^2 - \beta D - \frac{1}{2}(u^2 + iu), \qquad D(0)=0 $$

$$ \frac{dC}{d\tau} = (r-q)iu + \kappa\theta D(u,\tau), \qquad C(0)=0 $$

Solving these gives us the closed form below, and removing the spot factor $e^{iu\log S_0}$ leaves the return characteristic function $\varphi_{\mathrm{ret}}=\exp(C+Dv_0)$.

**Intermediate terms.**

$$\beta = \kappa - \rho\xi iu, \qquad d = \sqrt{\beta^{2} + \xi^{2}\left(u^{2}+iu\right)}, \qquad g = \frac{\beta - d}{\beta + d}$$

- $\beta$ represents the effective mean-reversion rate which is the base reversion speed $\kappa$ shifted by the price–variance correlation $\rho\xi iu$ that the frequency component feels.
- $d$ is the **discriminant** of the Riccati equation's associated quadratic.
- $g$ is the **integration constant** fixed by the initial condition $D(0)=0$, controlling the shape of the interpolation in $D$.

**Affine coefficients.**

$$D(u,\tau) = \frac{\beta-d}{\xi^{2}}\cdot\frac{1-e^{-d\tau}}{1-ge^{-d\tau}}$$

$D$ is the coefficient on $v_0$ that measures how strongly the distribution depends on current variance. It is zero at $\tau=0$ and saturates to $(\beta-d)/\xi^2$ as $\tau\to\infty$, since mean reversion eventually washes out the initial variance.

$$C(u,\tau) = (r-q)iu\tau + \frac{\kappa\theta}{\xi^{2}}\left[(\beta-d)\tau - 2\log\left(\frac{1-g\,e^{-d\tau}}{1-g}\right)\right]$$

$C$ is the part independent of $v_0$. It accumulates the deterministic drift $(r-q)iu\tau$ and the long-run variance $\theta$ pumped in through the $\kappa\theta$ term over the whole path.

**The characteristic function.**

$$\varphi_{\mathrm{ret}}(u;\tau,\Psi) = \exp\big(C(u,\tau) + D(u,\tau)\,v_0\big)$$

The log of the CF is linear in $v_0$. This affine structure is the reason the closed form exists at all.

## Carr-Maden Pricing

**Why naive Fourier inversion fails.** A call option has payoff $\max(S_T - K, 0)$. We can write this as a function of $k = \log K$, and hope to recover call prices at all strikes simultaneously by Fourier-inverting $\varphi$. The issue with this approach is that the call price $C(k)$ does not decay as $k \to -\infty$: deep in-the-money calls are worth approximately $S_0 - Ke^{-r\tau}$, which grows without bound as $K \to 0$. A function that doesn't decay can't be Fourier-transformed in the usual sense.

**The Carr-Madan damping trick.** The fix to this is to multiply the call price by a decaying exponential before we apply the transform. Define the modified call price:

$$\tilde{c}(k) = e^{\alpha k} C(k), \quad \alpha > 1$$

Because $e^{\alpha k}$ decays as $k \to -\infty$ faster than $C(k)$ grows, $\tilde{c}(k)$ is square-integrable meaning its Fourier transform exists. Call this transform $\Psi_\alpha(u)$. Substituting the risk-neutral pricing formula $C(k) = e^{-r\tau}\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}[\max(S_T - e^k, 0)]$ and computing the Fourier transform, we obtain:

$$\Psi_\alpha(u) = \frac{e^{-r\tau} \varphi(u - (\alpha+1)i)}{\alpha^2 + \alpha - u^2 + i(2\alpha + 1)u}$$

where $\varphi$ is evaluated at the complex argument $u - (\alpha+1)i$. The denominator is the Fourier transform of the intrinsic payoff structure; the numerator carries all the model-specific information through $\varphi$. Call prices at all strikes can then be recovered by inverting this transform:

$$C(k) = \frac{e^{-\alpha k}}{\pi} \int_0^\infty e^{-iuk} \Psi_\alpha(u) \, du$$

## Translating Option Prices to Implied Volatilities

In order to translate the options prices into market-implied volatility, we rearrange the Black-Scholes formula (obtained by applying Fiemann-Kac to a constant volatility). Option price under Black-Scholes are given by:

$$ C = e^{-r\tau}\left(FN(d_1) - KN(d_2)\right), \qquad P = e^{-r\tau}\left(KN(-d_2) - FN(-d_1)\right) $$

$$ d_1 = \frac{\log(F/K) + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\tau}{\sigma\sqrt{\tau}}, \qquad d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{\tau} $$

$$F = S e^{r\tau}$$

Since the price of an option under Black-Scholes is strictly increasing with respect to increases in volatility, the inverse is well defined, and a bisection inversion is guaranteed to converge. So we repeatedly bisect an interval, starting at $[\sigma_{lo},\sigma_{hi} = [10^{-6}, 5.0]$, until $\left| BS(\sigma_{\mathrm{mid}}) - C_{\mathrm{mkt}} \right| < 10^{-7}$

## Sampling Parameters

First we need a define a distribution over the Heston parameter space that is realistic and well-suited for training. We choose the following bounds:

| Parameter | Lower | Upper |
|---|---|---|
| $v_0$ | 0.01 | 0.25 |
| $\kappa$ | 0.50 | 8.00 |
| $\theta$ | 0.01 | 0.25 |
| $\xi$ | 0.10 | 1.00 |
| $\rho$ | −0.95 | −0.10 |

$v_0 \in [0.01, 0.25]$ corresponds to initial volatility ranging from 10% to 50%. The $\rho \in [-0.95, -0.10]$ reflects the leverage effect, a positive $\rho$ would mean we have an asset whose volatility rises when prices rise, which is not observed in equity markets.

**Latin Hypercube Sampling.** Instead of uniform random parameter vector sampling, we use Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). This is because uniform random sampling of $n$ points in $d$ dimensions tends to leave large regions of parameter space unvisited, as random samples can potentially cluster. LHS solves this by partitioning each marginal dimension into $n$ equal-probability intervals and ensuring exactly one sample falls in each interval. We now have a sample that covers the parameter space much more evenly than pure Monte Carlo for the same value of $n$, which is significant in this context because we want the model to have seen surfaces from all corners of the parameter space, not just the regions where random sampling happens to cluster.

**Feller condition enforcement.** After sampling, we discard any parameter vector for which $2\kappa\theta \leq \xi^2$. This is the Feller condition from Section 2. When violated, it means that variance process $v_t$ can reach zero, and then the Heston characteristic function formula used requires modification. Because of this, we oversample by a factor of three and then filter, because LHS with aggressive Feller filtering could otherwise distort the marginal distributions.
